# lxc-idmap-calculator
A raw script for generating UID and GID mappings for unprivileged containers

See https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Unprivileged_LXC_containers

NB:  After adding the maps to the config and starting the container, the mapping mightn't take first go.  Stop and restart the container and check again. 

Use at your own risk, this is not fully tested
